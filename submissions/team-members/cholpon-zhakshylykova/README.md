# 📘 International Education Budget Planner

This project provides a predictive pipeline to estimate the **Total Cost of Attendance (TCA)** for international students based on reduced but essential factors such as program, university, and living costs. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), a streamlined machine learning pipeline, feature importance analysis, and an interactive Streamlit web application.

---

## 🔍 Objective
Build a lightweight and interpretable machine learning model to estimate the financial burden of studying abroad using reduced real-world cost indicators.

---

## 🧪 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Checked for missing values and data quality issues
- Explored distributions of tuition, rent, and other numeric costs
- Analyzed category balance in `University`, `Program`, and `Level`
- Used boxplots and histograms to visualize cost variations
- Investigated cost clustering using domain-specific heuristics

EDA insights guided feature reduction and selection.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline
- Models: `RandomForestRegressor`, `GradientBoostingRegressor`, `XGBoost`
- Data preprocessing with `OneHotEncoder` and `StandardScaler`
- Pipeline and model tracking using `MLflow`
- Feature importance visualization

**Target variable:** `Total_cost`

### Feature Engineering
- **Categorical**: University, Program, Level
- **Numerical**: Living Index, Rent, Insurance, Visa Fees, Duration

## 📦 Feature Selection Philosophy

This version retains **a minimal subset of features** based on data-driven reduction while preserving domain-critical fields.

### Why?
- Reduces noise and complexity
- Improves generalizability
- Still captures the core cost drivers based on EDA and prior importance plots

### 📈 Grouped Importance Visual
- ![Grouped Feature Importance](grouped_feature_importance.png)

**Conclusion:** Simpler feature sets were tested to achieve better bias-variance trade-off without losing critical context.

## 📈 Outputs
- Model evaluation metrics: MAE, RMSE, R²
- Grouped feature importance graph
- Prediction vs Actual plot
- Classification report of affordability tiers (Low, Medium, High)
- MLflow run logs and model artifacts

## 💻 Streamlit Web App
### Key Features:
- Predicts TCA based on user inputs
- Interactive affordability world map
- Cluster segment explorer by cost tiers

Launches with:
```bash
streamlit run webapp.py
```

---

## 🧪 How to Run the Model Pipeline
```bash
python mlflow_run.py
```
This trains models, logs results to MLflow, and exports:
- `model_pipeline.pkl` — best model pipeline
- `grouped_feature_importance.png` — feature analysis
- `model_predictions.csv` — final evaluation predictions
