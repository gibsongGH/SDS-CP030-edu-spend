# Project Scope of Works:

## Project Overview
**EduSpend** transforms a rich international dataset of tuition fees, living-cost indices, rent, visa charges, and insurance premiums into actionable insights for students, consultants, and policymakers. The project will:

- benchmark real costs across countries, cities, and degree levels;
- predict total cost of attendance (TCA) for any program profile;
- classify destinations into affordability tiers;
- segment universities by cost structures;
- deliver an interactive Streamlit app for budget planning and market comparison.

## Project Objectives
### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Profile cost distributions by **Country**, **City**, **Level**, and **Program**.
- Visualize correlations among **Tuition_USD**, **Living_Cost_Index**, **Rent_USD**, and **Exchange_Rate**.
- Compute baseline **Total Cost of Attendance** (tuition + rent × months + visa + insurance × years).
- Detect outliers and assess currency-conversion stability.

### Feature Engineering + Model Development
1. **Derived Features**
    - One-hot encode categoricals; scale/transform numeric costs.
    - Create TCA and affordability-tier labels (e.g., Low/Medium/High via quantiles).

2. **Predictive Tasks**
    - **TCA Regressor**: estimate total study cost from program specs and location features.
    - **Affordability Classifier**: label each record _Low_, _Medium_, or _High_ cost.

3. **Clustering**
    - Group universities/destinations into cost archetypes via K-Means or HDBSCAN on scaled features.

4. **Evaluation & Tuning**
    - Regression → MAE, RMSE, R².
    - Classification → Accuracy, Macro F1, ROC-AUC.
    - Clustering → Silhouette Score + qualitative review.
    - Hyperparameter search for tree-based and gradient-boosted models.

### Model Deployment
- **Streamlit Web App**
    - Budget Planner: users enter target country, level, duration, and see TCA forecasts.
    - Affordability Map & Dashboards.
    - Cluster Explorer with segment descriptions.

- Host on **Streamlit Community Cloud** with README and user guide.

## Technical Requirements

* **Data handling**: `pandas`, `numpy`
* **Visualization**: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`
* **Machine-learning & evaluation**: `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `lightgbm`, `mlflow`
* **Clustering & dimensionality reduction**: `KMeans`, `HDBSCAN`, `PCA` or `UMAP`
* **Deployment stack**: `Streamlit` for the web interface
* **Runtime environment**: Python 3.9+ in a managed `conda` or `venv` environment


## Workflow

### **Phase 1: Setup & EDA (1 Week)**
- Setup GitHub repo and project folders
- Setup virtual environment and respective libraries
- Data anlysis of key features effecting study costs and affordability
- Answering questions set out in the Objectives section for EDA.

### **Phase 2: Model Development (3 Weeks)**
- Feature engineering
- Model experimentation with ML Flow
- Build, traing, test, evaluate different models
- Build a pipeline to use for Deployment phase

### **Phase 3: Deployment (1 Week)**
- Build a basic Streamlit UI to use your model
- Deploy to Streamlit cloud
